Shows the daily sunrise and sunset times obtained from the API **sunrisesunset.io**, on two separate pages. Currently, it shows the sunrise and sunset times in the borough of Newham, London, in the middle of a circular "Sun" widget, against different gradient backgrounds reminiscent of the sunrise or sunset depending on which page you navigate to.

Interactivity:
Users can tap anywhere on the screen on either display page to change pages.
Its functions are simple because **it aims to provide users with the time information they need from a relaxing interface without distractions** and encourage them to spend time appreciating nature instead of looking at their phone.
